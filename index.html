<p>
I'm currently an associate software engineer for <a href="http://www.constantcontact.com">Constant Contact</a> in New York, NY. I began my coding journey in the winter of 2013 by attending the <a href="http://www.flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>. Previously, I worked at Disney and Citi.
</p>

<p>
I graduated from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in 2010 with a B.S. in Business Administration and a minor in Policy and Management.

When I'm not hacking at my keyboard, you will likely find me somewhere outdoors, reading, playing basketball, and spending time with friends.
